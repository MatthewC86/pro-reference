# Professional Reference



This was designed to showcase HTML and CSS skills to future employers.





Added nav bar to upper right and added white text to make them easier to read.

Added border just below header for styling.

Flex boxes were used for content to ensure they could be styled, later down the road, once more content is created.

Contact buttons were added, instead of straight info, to make the site more dynamic.

I used Google, W3Schools and met with a tutor to creat this landing page.

I learned how to properly write CSS as you make sections in HTML.
